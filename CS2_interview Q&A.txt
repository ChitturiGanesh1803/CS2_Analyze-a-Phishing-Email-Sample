1. What is phishing?

Phishing is a social‑engineering attack where attackers pose as trusted entities to trick people into giving up sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or opening harmful attachments.

2. How do you identify a phishing email?

Check the sender address, look for urgent or threatening language, hover over links, inspect attachments, review headers, and look for spelling or formatting mistakes.

3. What is email spoofing?

It’s when attackers forge the “From” address to make the email look like it came from a legitimate sender.

4. Why are phishing emails dangerous?

They can steal credentials, deliver malware, cause financial loss, or lead to data breaches.

5. How can you verify the sender’s authenticity?

Check the domain, inspect email headers, verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC results, or contact the sender through an official channel (not by replying to the email).

6. What tools can analyze email headers?

Google Admin Toolbox

MXToolbox Header Analyzer

Microsoft Message Header Analyzer

MessageHeader.org

7. What actions should be taken on suspected phishing emails?

Do not click anything, report it to your security team or IT helpdesk, block the sender, and delete the message.

8. How do attackers use social engineering in phishing?

They exploit emotions like fear, urgency, curiosity, or trust to push victims into acting quickly without verifying details.
