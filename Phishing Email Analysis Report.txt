Phishing Email Analysis Report

Sample Email:
From: PayPal Security <security@paypal-verify.com>
Subject: Urgent: Verify your account
Date: Thu, 11 Dec 2025 18:59:00 +0000

1. Suspicious Sender Address

Email: security@paypal-verify.com

Red flags:

Domain paypal-verify.com is not the official PayPal domain (paypal.com).

Slight variation is a common tactic to trick users.

2. Email Header Analysis

Received: Shows originating server mail.example.com [192.0.2.1], which is not a PayPal server.

SPF: Failed (domain of security@paypal-verify.com does not designate 192.0.2.1 as permitted sender).

DKIM: Failed (signature not verified).

DMARC: Failed (header.from=paypal-verify.com).

Interpretation: The email fails multiple authentication checks, confirming it is spoofed.

3. Suspicious Links

URL in email: https://example-phish.com/verify-paypal

Red flags:

Domain does not match PayPal’s official site.

Hovering over the link (without clicking) would reveal the mismatch.

4. Urgent or Threatening Language

Phrases like:

“Click the link below to verify within 24 hours”

“or your account will be limited”

This creates pressure to act immediately, a common phishing tactic.

5. Spelling/Grammar Errors

Minor issues; email text is fairly clean.

However, professional companies rarely phrase urgent threats this bluntly in official emails.

6. Other Phishing Traits

Generic greeting: “Dear Valued Customer” instead of your actual name.

Requests personal action via a link rather than providing official channels.

Email comes from a free or unrelated server (mail.example.com), not PayPal’s infrastructure.
